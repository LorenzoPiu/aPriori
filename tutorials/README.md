# Tutorials 🕹️

This folder contains the code that can be found in the tutorials section of the [documentation](https://apriori.gitbook.io/apriori-documentation-1/fundamentals-and-usage/apriori-fundamentals).
I hope these explain how to properly use the code, and feel free to add an issue or to send me an e-mail at lorenzo.piu@ulb.be to ask for help or give me feedback!

Enjoy 😉
